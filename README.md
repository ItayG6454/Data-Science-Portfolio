## Projects in this representory:

### 1 : "Is Its getting HOT on here?"  | R Project
It is not really a question whatever it is become hotter in here. The question is : **When and How much**.
In this project We will try to find the **change of point** in the Israelis summer temperatures distribution.
We will use  LOO Cros Validation to *comaper three different CPD mehthods* and describve their prons and cons upon real dataset.

### 2 : "Happily Ever After" | Python Project
What are the factor that impact our abilty to live longer?
In this project we will examine the WHO (World Health Organization) database to predict the life expectancy of a country based on some factors. 
Implementing data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. Training eight different models:
- Regression: Linear, Ridge, Ada Boosting Regressor, SVR
- Classification: Random Forest, KNN
-Gradient Boosting Regressor

At last :  comparing the models upon test data their $R^2$ score with K-Fold Cross-Validation and analyzing feature importance.
